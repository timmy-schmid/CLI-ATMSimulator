Here, we can write general rules, git commands + setting up for testing and any notes on merging conflicts or problems faced etc

Check and edit the google doc for git commands if needed

# getting started

<b> Git clone URL </b> # download this repository → first time only
<b> Cd directory_name </b> 
Git checkout -b branch_name #creates new branch then switch to this branch


# Edit or create any files

Git add <file>
Git commit -m “comment”
Git checkout origin
Git merge branch_name

# Making changes to a file: <u> always pull before a push! </u>

<b> Git checkout master </b> #go to master 
Git pull #ensures changes are updated
<b> Git checkout branch_name</b> #if branch_name already exists, else to create new branch: git checkout -b new_branch_name
Git merge master #add changes updated in master and merges back into your own branch
If there is a merge conflict it means someone edited the same line you were working on earlier <<<<< HEAD (represents you), ====== (someone else added this)
Go to lines 14-17.
<b> Git push -u origin branch_name </b>#this branch is pushed onto github
