ASSIGNMENT 1 WORKING IN PROGRESS!

Check and edit the google doc for git commands if needed

# 1. FOLLOW THIS TO GRAB NEWEST CHANGES FROM GITHUB, merging with your local branch files!!!!

# 2. FOLLOW THIS TO SUBMIT ONLY YOUR BRANCH/PART ONTO GITHUB!! 
Git add . (adds all your changes) OR git add (file) --> git commit -m “message” → git push -u origin branch_name

# 3. FOLLOW THIS TO MERGE UR CHANGES  TO MASTER!!
-> git pull (do this first to prevent merge conflicts) 
    THEN:
-> git checkout master --> git merge branch_name --> git push

# TODO !!!!! [Add below any other notes to check out]

-> make sure indenting is 2 spaces, use CamelCase for variable naming!

-> add a user "Name" in card constructor??

-> keep code consistent + nicely styled + minimise redundancy

-> WITHDRAWAL CLASS
  -> Consider what if the highest amount for MoneyType runs out (user wants to withdraw money), then use the next available highest amount to do calculations

-> If user's card doesn't have enough money stored inside to withdraw, give option/cancel for user to switch to a different card

-> How to handle user's deposit? 
  -> "prompt the user on how many of each denomination they want to deposit, calling from ATM class function ATM.askForMoneyStack()" - Tim

-> Should we have a list to store a multiple cards of 1 user?

-> CARD CLASS: store a list of diff types/in constructor add 'type'
